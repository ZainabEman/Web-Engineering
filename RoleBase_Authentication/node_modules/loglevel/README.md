> _Don't debug with logs alone - check out [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.tech/javascript): beautiful, powerful & open-source tools for building, testing & debugging HTTP(S)_

Minimal lightweight simple logging for JavaScript (browsers, node.js or elsewhere). loglevel extends `console.log()` & friends with level-based logging and filtering, with none of console's downsides.

Test it out live in your browser console at https://pimterry.github.io/loglevel/demo/index.html

Loglevel is a barebones reliable everyday logging library. It does not do fancy things, it does not let you reconfigure appenders or add complex log filtering rules or boil tea (more's the pity), but it does have the all core functionality that you actually use:

## Features

### Simple

* Log things at a given level (trace/debug/info/warn/error) to the `console` object (as seen in all modern browsers & node.js).
* Filter logging by level (all the above or 'silent'), so you can disable all but error logging in production, and then run `log.setLevel("trace")` in your console to turn it all back on for a furious debugging session.
* Single file, no dependencies, weighs in at 1.4 KB minified and gzipped.

### Effective

* Log methods gracefully fall back to simpler console logging methods if more specific ones aren't available: so calls to `log.debug()` go to `console.debug()` if possible, or `console.log()` if not.
* Logging calls still succeed even if there's no `console` object at all, so your site doesn't break when people visit with old browsers that don't support the `console` object (here's looking at you, IE) and similar.
* This then comes together giving a consistent reliable API that works in every JavaScript environment with a console available, and never breaks anything anywhere else.

### Convenient

* Log output keeps line numbers: most JS logging frameworks call `console.log` methods through wrapper functions, clobbering your stacktrace and making the extra info many browsers provide useless. We'll have none of that thanks.
* It works with all the standard JavaScript loading systems out of the box (CommonJS, AMD, or just as a global).
* Logging is filtered to "warn" level by default, to keep your live site clean in normal usage (or you can trivially re-enable everything with an initial `log.enableAll()` call).
* Magically handles situations where console logging is not initially available (IE8/9), and automatically enables logging as soon as it does become available (when developer console is opened).
* TypeScript type definitions included, so no need for extra `@types` packages.
* Extensible, to add other log redirection, filtering, or formatting functionality, while keeping all the above (except you will clobber your stacktrace, see [“Plugins”](#plugins) below).

## Downloading loglevel

If you're using NPM, you can just run `npm install loglevel`.

Alternatively, loglevel is also available via [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) (`bower install loglevel`), as a [Webjar](http://www.webjars.org/), or an [Atmosphere package](https://atmospherejs.com/spacejamio/loglevel) (for Meteor)

Alternatively if you just want to grab the file yourself, you can download either the current stable [production version][min] or the [development version][max] directly, or reference it remotely on unpkg at [`https://unpkg.com/loglevel/dist/loglevel.min.js`][cdn] (this will redirect to a latest version, use the resulting redirected URL if you want to pin that version).

Finally, if you want to tweak loglevel to your own needs or you immediately need the cutting-edge version, clone this repo and see [Developing & Contributing](#developing--contributing) below for build instructions.

## Setting it up

loglevel supports AMD (e.g. RequireJS), CommonJS (e.g. Node.js) and direct usage (e.g. loading globally with a `<script>` tag) loading methods. You should be able to do nearly anything, and then skip to the next section anyway and have it work. Just in case, though, here's some specific examples that definitely do the right thing:

### CommonsJS (e.g. Node)

```javascript
var log = require('loglevel');
log.warn("unreasonably simple");
```

### AMD (e.g. RequireJS)

```javascript
define(['loglevel'], function(log) {
   log.warn("dangerously convenient");
});
```

### Directly in your web page

```html
<script src="loglevel.min.js"></script>
<script>
log.warn("too easy");
</script>
```

### As an ES6 module

loglevel is written as a UMD module, with a single object exported. Unfortunately, ES6 module loaders & transpilers don't all handle this the same way. Some will treat the object as the default export, while others use it as the root exported object. In addition, loglevel includes a `default` property on the root object, designed to help handle this difference. Nonetheless, there are two possible syntaxes that might work for you:

For most tools, using the default import is the most convenient and flexible option:

```javascript
import log from 'loglevel';
log.warn("module-tastic");
```

For some tools though, it might better to wildcard import the whole object:

```javascript
import * as log from 'loglevel';
log.warn("module-tastic");
```

There's no major difference, unless you're using TypeScript & building a loglevel plugin (in that case, see <https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/149>). In general though, just use whichever suits your environment, and everything should work out fine.

### With noConflict()

If you're using another JavaScript library that exposes a `log` global, you can run into conflicts with loglevel. Similarly to jQuery, you can solve this by putting loglevel into no-conflict mode immediately after it is loaded onto the page. This resets the `log` global to its value before loglevel was loaded (typically `undefined`), and returns the loglevel object, which you can then bind to another name yourself.

For example:

```html
<script src="loglevel.min.js"></script>
<script>
var logging = log.noConflict();

logging.warn("still pretty easy");
</script>
```

### TypeScript

loglevel includes its own type definitions, assuming you're using a modern module environment (e.g. Node.JS, webpack, etc), you should be able to use the ES6 syntax above, and everything will work immediately. If not, file a bug!

If you really want to use LogLevel as a global however, but from TypeScript, you'll need to declare it as such first. To do that:

* Create a `loglevel.d.ts` file
* Ensure that file is included in your build (e.g. add it to `include` in your tsconfig, pass it on the command line, or use `///<reference path="./loglevel.d.ts" />`)
* In that file, add:

  ```typescript
  import * as log from 'loglevel';
  export as namespace log;
  export = log;
  ```

## Documentation

### Methods

The loglevel API is extremely minimal. All methods are available on the root loglevel object, which we suggest you name `log` (this is the default if you import it globally, and is what's set up in the above examples). The API consists of:

#### Logging Methods

5 actual logging methods, ordered and available as:

* `log.trace(msg)`
* `log.debug(msg)`
* `log.info(msg)`
* `log.warn(msg)`
* `log.error(msg)`

`log.log(msg)` is also available, as an alias for `log.debug(msg)`, to improve compatibility with `console`, and make migration easier.

Exact output formatting of these will depend on the console available in the current context of your application. For example, many environments will include a full stack trace with all `trace()` calls, and icons or similar to highlight other calls.

These methods should never fail in any environment, even if no `console` object is currently available, and should always fall back to an available log method even if the specific method called (e.g. `warn`) isn't available.

Be aware that this means that these methods won't always produce exactly the output you expect in every environment; loglevel only guarantees that these methods will never explode on you, and that it will call the most relevant method it can find, with your argument. For example, `log.trace(msg)` in Firefox before version 64 prints the stacktrace by itself, and doesn't include your message (see [#84](https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/84)).

#### `log.setLevel(level, [persist])`

This disables all logging below the given level, so that after a `log.setLevel("warn")` call `log.warn("something")` or `log.error("something")` will output messages, but `log.info("something")` will not.

This can take either a log level name or `'silent'` (which disables everything) in one of a few forms:

* As a log level from the internal levels list, e.g. `log.levels.SILENT` ← _for type safety_
* As a string, like `'error'` (case-insensitive) ← _for a reasonable practical balance_
* As a numeric index from `0` (trace) to `5` (silent) ← _deliciously terse, and more easily programmable (...although, why?)_

Where possible, the log level will be persisted. LocalStorage will be used if available, falling back to cookies if not. If neither is available in the current environment (e.g. in Node), or if you pass `false` as the optional 'persist' second argument, persistence will be skipped.

If `log.setLevel()` is called when a `console` object is not available (in IE 8 or 9 before the developer tools have been opened, for example) logging will remain silent until the console becomes available, and then begin logging at the requested level.

#### `log.setDefaultLevel(level)`

This sets the current log level only if one has not been persisted and can’t be loaded. This is useful when initializing modules or scripts; if a developer or user has previously called `setLevel()`, this won’t alter their settings. For example, your application might use `setDefaultLevel("error")` set the log level to `error` in a production environment, but when debugging an issue, you might call `setLevel("trace")` on the console to see all the logs. If that `error` setting was set using `setDefaultLevel()`, it will still stay as `trace` on subsequent page loads and refreshes instead of resetting to `error`.

The `level` argument takes the same values that you might pass to `setLevel()`. Levels set using `setDefaultLevel()` never persist to subsequent page loads.

#### `log.resetLevel()`

This resets the current log level to the logger's default level (if no explicit default was set, then it resets it to the root logger's level, or to `WARN`) and clears the persisted level if one was previously persisted.

#### `log.enableAll()` and `log.disableAll()`

These enable or disable all log messages, and are equivalent to `log.setLevel("trace")` and `log.setLevel("silent")`, respectively.

#### `log.getLevel()`

Returns the current logging level, as a number from `0` (trace) to `5` (silent)

It's very unlikely you'll need to use this for normal application logging; it's provided partly to help plugin development, and partly to let you optimize logging code as below, where debug data is only generated if the level is set such that it'll actually be logged. This probably doesn't affect you, unless you've run profiling on your code and you have hard numbers telling you that your log data generation is a real performance problem.

```javascript
if (log.getLevel() <= log.levels.DEBUG) {
  var logData = runExpensiveDataGeneration();
  log.debug(logData);
}
```

This notably isn't the right solution to avoid the cost of string concatenation in your logging. Firstly, it's very unlikely that string concatenation in your logging is really an important performance problem. Even if you do genuinely have hard metrics showing that it is, though, the better solution that wrapping your log statements in this is to use multiple arguments, as below. The underlying console API will automatically concatenate these for you if logging is enabled, and if it isn't then all log methods are no-ops, and no concatenation will be done at all.

```javascript
// Prints 'My concatenated log message'
log.debug("My", "concatenated", "log message");
```

#### `log.getLogger(loggerName)`

This gets you a new logger object that works exactly like the root `log` object, but can have its level and logging methods set independently. All loggers must have a name (which is a non-empty string, or a [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)). Calling `getLogger()` multiple times with the same name will return an identical logger object.

In large applications, it can be incredibly useful to turn logging on and off for particular modules as you are working with them. Using the `getLogger()` method lets you create a separate logger for each part of your application with its own logging level.

Likewise, for small, independent modules, using a named logger instead of the default root logger allows developers using your module to selectively turn on deep, trace-level logging when trying to debug problems, while logging only errors or silencing logging altogether under normal circumstances.

Example usage _(using CommonJS modules, but you could do the same with any module system):_

```javascript
// In module-one.js:
var log = require("loglevel").getLogger("module-one");
function doSomethingAmazing() {
  log.debug("Amazing message from module one.");
}

// In module-two
